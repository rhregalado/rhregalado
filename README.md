Scientist-in-training in Molecular Biology and Biotechnology
---
Kumusta! My name is Ric. I am currently a Masters student at the [National Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology](https://nimbb.upd.edu.ph/) at the University of the Philippines Diliman (UP Diliman) 🇵🇭, working with the molecular toxicology group led by [Prof. Jose Enrico H. Lazaro](https://nimbb.upd.edu.ph/faculty/jhlazaro/).

My research interests lie at the intersection of molecular biology 🧬 and microbiology 🦠 and currently, my research focus centers on studying bacterial genomes in heavy metal-polluted soils, employing a combination of bioinformatics, computational and systems biology, and omics tools to unlock their biosynthetic potential. This line of inquiry holds promise for unraveling novel metabolic pathways and natural products, offering valuable insights into their ecological roles and potential biotechnological applications.
